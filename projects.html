                    <p>#TeamTrees is a year-long 2019 initiative that managed to raise $20 million before
                        2020 to plant 20 million trees. Activism on YouTube takes on many form, for example, using kill count
                        in Diablo to donate to the campaign. Using YouTube's metadata, we want to investigate how different
                        category of content creators participate in a good-cause social media campaign via a case study of #TeamTrees.

                <p>  User-shared videos generate parasocial attachment and virtual connectedness. However, there is limited knowledge
                    of how creators contributed videos during disasters to provide social provisions as disaster-relief.
                    We used Weiss's loneliness theory to examine how YouTubers provided friend-like, mentor-like,
                    and family-like provisions through videos in different styles.

                <h3>Emotional Analysis Via Content Creation on YouTube During COVID-19</h3>
                <p> This is my final project for my class with Nguyen Ha. We were interested in the emotional response
                    and coping mechanism of content creators on YouTube during COVID-19. We applied the fight-or-flight framework to analyze how content
                    creators could contribute to mental health for audience.
                    Our approach was to analyze the description and hashtags of the video and use a classifier to create a predictive
                    tagging model.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Remark:</strong> I wish our analysis on emotional analysis was stronger and we had dived deeper into the evaluation of our classifier.
                    Affection and support via YouTube content is explored in depth and more rigorously in our lab's <i>#StayHome #WithMe - A Call for Videos During COVID-19</i> paper.

                    <p>For 3 years, I worked with Dr. Sarah Michaels at the wonderful <a href="https://www.ngsx.org/" target="_blank">NGSX Learning Lab</a>
                        to observe and improve science curriculum
                        for underfunded Worcester high schools. We in turn used our field data to improve professional development for K-12 science educators.
                        <br><br>
                        I was particularly interested in using <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342163333_Classroom_Discourse_Analyzer_CDA_A_Discourse_Analytic_Tool_for_Teachers" target="_blank">
                            Classroom Discourse Analyzer</a> and building a machine learning model
                        to understand how different factors like teacher's talk moves, class composition, seating arrangement would
                        affect discussion equity -- the notion that students deserve to lead classroom discussion and talk time.
                        We looked at turn-depth of a teacher-student conversation and tried to find patterns of highly productive
                        student-driven discussion.
                        Unfortunately, our work did not result in any tangible output.

                    My early attempts at creating the photogrammetry of the statues helped Dr. Gartonâ€™s colleague to secure a
